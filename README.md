## Getopts example

Usage:

~~~ text
â–¶ bash test.sh -a -b baz qux quux quuz
You passed baz to -b, -a is true, and then passed qux quux quuz after that
~~~

## test.sh

This is a test script.

## Test

1. It copies the .bash_profile
`cp /PATH-TO-YOUR-PROFILE/.bash_profile /BACKUP-DESTINATION/macOS-.bash_profile-backup`
2. Then we enter your backup destination.
`cd /BACKUP-DESTINATION/macOS-.bash_profile-backup`
3. With `git add .` we add all files into the GitHub repository.
4. We commit all files with comment from script execution time
`date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`"; <br>`git commit -a -m "generated files on date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`";
5. And at the very end we push to GitHub. `git push origin master`
