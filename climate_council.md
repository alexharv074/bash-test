None of these points made by the Climate Council against nuclear power stand up to serious scrutiny. I will address each point in the order as it appears in the article.

- Lifecycle emissions of a nuclear power plant

The Climate Council writes:

> Unlike coal and gas, no greenhouse gas pollution is created in the operation of the nuclear reactor. However, all other steps involved in producing nuclear power (from mining, to construction, decommissioning and waste management) result in greenhouse gas pollution.

This is true but it is also true of all renewable energy.

I refer the reader to the most recent IPCC WGIII AR5 report, Chapter 7, p. 539.
https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf

As can be seen, nuclear power emits less CO2 over its lifecycle than any other form of power other than unbuffered wind power i.e. wind power without storage. Meanwhile, hydropower - particularly in warm temperate to tropical climates like Australia - can emit as much as or more CO2-equivalent in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as coal. Many forms of biomass are environmentally destructive and polluting (e.g. wood burning) and/or compete with food for agricultural land (e.g. corn fuels). Indonesian palm oil sometimes gets counted towards European renewable energy targets - and still emits far more CO2-equivalent in GHGs than nuclear! Household PV solar also emits more CO2 in its lifecycle than nuclear. See Graham Palmer's work on this for instance.

Perhaps the Climate Council is using (anti-nuclear activist and paid wind industry consultant) Benjamin Sovacool's discredited numbers rather than those accepted by the IPCC consensus?

With all of that said, even the IPCC AR5's estimates likely overstate lifecycle CO2 emissions of nuclear power. The most energy-intensive part of the nuclear fuel cycle is uranium enrichment and historically that has been done using the highly energy intensive method of gaseous diffusion. See here:

> Gaseous diffusion was the first commercial process used in the United States to enrich uranium. These facilities utilized massive amounts of electricity and as the centrifuge technology matured the existing gaseous diffusion plants became obsolete. Worldwide they have all been replaced by second-generation technology, which requires far less electric power to produce equivalent amounts of separated uranium. These facilities are now considered obsolete.

And these are no longer used anywhere in the world:

In addition, with the advent of the next generation of nuclear technology, up to 90% of the fuel rod (or 100% in a breeder reactor) is consumed, and while data is not available, we should expect the lifecycle CO2 emissions of these to be far less than even the already low emissions of Generation II nuclear.

- Is nuclear energy "renewable" and what is renewable?

The Climate Council states correctly that uranium is a finite resource like coal and gas. But they do not consider that the next generation of nuclear power plants consume spent fuel rods as fuel and there is enough energy in the 80 years or so of so-called nuclear "waste" as to power the whole earth for 100 years.

Furthermore, breeder reactors - such as Russia's 800MW BN-800 reactor that has been in operation for several years now - can produce more energy than they consume and they are, in fact, classified as renewable energy. See here for example:
http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm

The idea of renewable energy, however, is problematic in itself. The fuel of a solar PV farm is indeed "renewable", because it is the sun. The sun doesn't always shine when we need it to of course, but we can all agree that sunshine is free and limitless.

But we are only talking about the fuel. Why? A solar PV farm is built out of raw materials including steel, concrete, aluminium, glass, and hard to extract rare earth metals and these are anything but renewable, and a solar PV plant has a lifespan of only 20 years and requires maintenance throughout that period.

This situation should be compared to the ThorCon Molten Salt Reactor that Indonesia is building, whose lifespan can in principle be extended indefinitely as its parts are all fully recycled every 4 years.

Since this reactor can run on spent fuel rods - or even decommissioned nuclear warheads - which has the greater claim to being "renewable"? I think the ThorCon does.

- Nuclear power plants are highly controversial

It is a little disingenuous to say that nuclear power is controversial even as the Climate Council uses its platform to create anti-nuclear controversy. It is likely that the nuclear power would not be controversial in the absence of anti-nuclear groups like the Australian Greens and the Climate Council spreading misinformation about nuclear power.

- Nuclear power plants are risky and harmful?

The Climate Council writes:

> Nuclear power plants present significant community, health, environmental, and cost risks associated with potential impacts from extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as occurred in Fukushima, Japan in 2011

This really is not true.

There is not likely to be a single death from the Fukushima accident, according to the authoritative UNSCEAR 2013 report, although about 2,000 people were killed by the tsunami. There is also no ongoing health risk associated with the accident and no one has been or is is likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of ionising radiation. Nor is anyone likely to eat food containing dangerous levels of radioactive substances, and to inhale radioactive substances.

Australia of course is geologically stable and not tsunami- and earthquake-prone like Japan, but this is not to say that the risk of a tsunami should be ignored or is not serious.

But the problem of engineering a power plant to withstand a tsunami is not a hard problem to solve. Just as engineering a plant to withstand any magnitude of earthquake is not hard either. After all, every reactor in Japan - 1970s technology and all - did shut itself down safely in response to the Earthquake.

The fact that the Japanese TEPCO had not protected the Fukushima power station from tsunamis is a tale of coverup and corruption. It is also a mistake that is unlikely to be repeated.

Of course, all of this is moot if the next generation of technology - such as the ThorCon Molten Salt Reactor that our neighbour is building - is walkaway safe. These reactors have no requirement of external power to safely shut themselves down, so the power outage that caused the Fukushima meltdown simply could not happen.

These reactors can't meltdown, because their cores are already molten. They can't overheat, even if an operator tries to force them to, because a freeze plug will melt underneath them and cause the molten fuel salts to drain into a cooling tank. In fact, the MSR could not cause a disaster even in the event of all containment being breached - think terrorist attack - because the radioactive compounds are chemically bound to the fuel salts.

But even if I confine myself to the Generation II Light Water Reactors (LWRs) that melted down at Chernobyl, Fukushima and partially at Three Mile Island, nuclear power is still by far the safest form of power per unit of energy produced.

- Australia is a sunny, windy country

This is true, and we also have 30% of the world's uranium and a virtually unlimited supply of thorium.

But it is misleading to say that we have enough resources "to power the whole country 500 times over". Consider that 80% of Australia's population is in the same timezone on the east coast of Australia, sharing the same solar noon. This means that solar power is not helpful for powering most of Australia during those two thirds of the day when the east coast solar PV is not generating. This leaves us with the option of giant wind turbines, and again, because the entire population is on the east coast, there is the problem of routing the power into major cities like Sydney and Brisbane.

Meanwhile, the European experience has shown that wind farms ultimately run up against fierce community resistance - the NIMBY problem. Think Joe Hockey. Or Bob Brown. The wind farms need to be built predominantly in National Party electorates, and they are likely to be opposed by communities for a range of reasons including that they are ugly, that they kill birds and bats, that they are noisy, that they lower the value of properties, and indeed that they increase the price of electricity. And the vast networks of transmission lines also get opposed by NIMBYs for the same reasons - they lower property values, are ugly, and some say the EM radiation causes leukemia in children.

Is it conceivable that 100% renewable energy will fail in Australia? Of course it is. It could easily get stuck at 30% or 50% and we'll find out in 10 or 20 years from now that something else is needed to supply the remaining 50% or 70% after all. Too bad that it will be too late to do so in time to be of any use in the climate change fight.

- Nuclear power plants are expensive

At the moment, it is true that nuclear power plants are expensive, whereas the next generation of nuclear power - again, such as the ThorCon MSR, thanks to its simpler design and fewer moving parts and inherent safety, which promises to be cheaper than coal. ThorCon believe they can mass produce 20 reactors per year. On the other hand, plants like the Generation III+ Hinkley Point C and others are expensive as a result of the need to make Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs) walkaway-safe.

Even leaving that aside, the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewables only considers the cost at low penetrations and ignores all the system costs needed to fully integrate high quantities of renewable energy into the grid. Once each wind farm needs to be added hundreds of kilometres from the population centres, and roads need to be built to service them, and transmission infrastructure - they get incredibly expensive. Already, we are seeing renewables projects get cancelled for this reason - once the need to build supporting infrastructure is included, they turn out to be no longer financially viable.

Do have a good read of the system costs of renewable energy vis a vis nuclear power in the OECD/NEA study:
https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2019/7299-system-costs.pdf

- Nuclear power plants take a decade to build

They do take a long time to build. The IPCC's First Assessment Report (FAR) urged us nearly 40 years ago to transition away from fossil fuels to nuclear power. And if we had built nuclear power plants here in Australia at the time of John Howard's nuclear power proposal, they would all be built now.

Considering no one expects Australia to be 100% renewable energy in the next 10 years, why not start now?

I should also add that wind farms in France also take 10 years to build.
https://www.thelocal.fr/20180807/why-do-some-people-in-france-hate-wind-farms-so-much

70% of wind farm proposals are challenged in court leading to an average time to build of around 10 years. The same as nuclear power. Could this happen here? Yes, it could.

- Nuclear power stations are inflexible

The Climate Council writes:

> Nuclear power stations are inflexible – that is, they cannot quickly increase or decrease the amount of electricity they produce.

This is generally true, and not because load following nuclear power plants can't be built, but because it is not economic to build them.

Once again, all of this changes with the next generation of technology such as the MSR.

- Nuclear power plants need a lot of water

The Climate Council writes:

> Nuclear power stations require massive quantities of water to operate. In a dry continent like Australia, prone to hot summers and drought conditions which are only likely to get more severe as climate change worsens, it would be reckless to rely on a water-hungry power source like nuclear.

It is true that conventional Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs) use a lot of water, and some of them can be cooled with sea water.

This is not an issue for the ThorCon MSR which does not require water to cool, and indeed, in a hot, dry country like Australia, we should be using nuclear power to create drinking water from sea water:
https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/industry/nuclear-desalination.aspx

- Bottom line

In summary, the Climate Council's claims about nuclear power are all either misleading or false or dependent on an assumption that we would use old LWR technology that was designed in the 1960s and 1970s, when obviously, that is not the case.

Section 140A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 should be repealed and all options should be on the table in the fight against climate change and it is disappointing to find the Climate Council fighting against this principle.
